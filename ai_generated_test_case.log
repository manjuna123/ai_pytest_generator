This test file covers the available endpoints from the OpenAPI specification (/users GET and POST). It uses the custom API keywords from api_keywords.robot for making the HTTP requests. The tests validate the response status codes, check the structure and content of the response data, and include detailed logging for better visibility. The setup and teardown handle session management and logging. Variables are used for the base URL. The tests have clear documentation and use proper Robot Framework syntax and conventions.
